Shopping Management System.
New Shop V2 is a Java-based desktop application built with Java Swing to provide a userfriendly shopping experience. It offers categorized shopping for Grocery, Electronics, Sports, and Medicine, with features like user registration, login, and cart management. Customers can add items to their cart, view product details, calculate totals, and generatebills with discount eligibility checks. The application also includes an admin role with placeholder features for managing users, products, and reports. Core software development concepts like Object-Oriented Programming, event-driven programming, GUI design, and file-based data management are demonstrated. Javaâ€™s ArrayList is used for efficient cart operations. Despite its robust features, the application lacks database integration, dynamic product management, and complete admin functionality. Developed by MD Sohanur Rahman Sohan, Redoanur Rahman, Sabbir Hossen Tapada and Mohimin Shikdar, New Shop V2 is a modular and practical project showcasing smooth multi-window navigation for shopping applications.
